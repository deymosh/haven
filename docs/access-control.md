# Access Control: Whitelisting and Blacklisting

Sanctum allows you to manage who can interact with your relay through whitelisting and blacklisting.

## Whitelisting

Whitelisting grants specific npubs the same permissions as the relay owner. 

### Permissions granted to whitelisted npubs:
- **Outbox Publishing**: Ability to publish notes to your outbox relay.
- **Blossom Media Server**: Ability to upload to your Blossom server, unless the blob's hash is on the relay's [blocklist](relay-management.md#deleting-and-blocking).
- **Private Relay Access**: Ability to read and write to your private relay (`/private`).
- **Web of Trust Bypass**: Whitelisted users are automatically trusted and do not need to be part of your Web of Trust 
  to interact with your Chat and Inbox relays.

### How to configure a Whitelist:
1. Create a JSON file (e.g., `whitelisted_npubs.json`) containing an array of npubs:
   ```json
   [
     "npub1...",
     "npub2..."
   ]
   ```
2. Set the `WHITELISTED_NPUBS_FILE` environment variable in your `.env` file to point to this file:
   ```env
   WHITELISTED_NPUBS_FILE=whitelisted_npubs.json
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> The relay owner's npub (defined by `OWNER_NPUB`) is automatically whitelisted. You don't need to add it to the file.

## Blacklisting

Blacklisting allows you to explicitly block specific npubs from interacting with your Sanctum relay, even if they would 
otherwise be allowed by the Web of Trust.

### Effects of Blacklisting:
- **Chat Relay**: Blacklisted users cannot send DMs or messages to your Chat relay.
- **Inbox Relay**: Your Inbox relay will reject notes from blacklisted users.
- **Import**: Events from blacklisted users will be skipped when importing from external relays (e.g., using 
 `./sanctum import` or from the live subscription to import relays).

> [!NOTE]
> Blacklisting does not affect Blossom Media Server access, Outbox publishing, or private relay access. In theory, you 
> could simultaneously whitelist and blacklist the same npub, which makes very little sense.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Blacklisting has no effect when [importing JSONL files](backup.md#manual-restore).

### How to configure a Blacklist:
1. Create a JSON file (e.g., `blacklisted_npubs.json`) containing an array of npubs:
   ```json
   [
     "npub1...",
     "npub2..."
   ]
   ```
2. Set the `BLACKLISTED_NPUBS_FILE` environment variable in your `.env` file to point to this file:
   ```env
   BLACKLISTED_NPUBS_FILE=blacklisted_npubs.json
   ```

## Banning Users

Banning stops a pubkey from writing anything to your relay. Unlike the blacklist, the ban list lives on nostr: it is a
[NIP-51](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/51.md) style replaceable list of kind `10084` that the
owner publishes to their own relay, so it can be edited from a client without touching a file or restarting Sanctum.

Every `p` tag on the list is a banned pubkey:

```json
{
  "kind": 10084,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<pubkey to ban>"],
    ["p", "<another pubkey to ban>"]
  ],
  "content": ""
}
```

Publish it to your outbox relay, for example:

```sh
nak event -k 10084 -t p=<pubkey> -t p=<other-pubkey> --sec <owner-nsec> wss://your.relay
```

Sanctum reads the latest version of the list from the outbox relay on startup and updates its cache the moment you
publish a new one, so adding or removing a pubkey takes effect immediately. Because the list is replaceable, each
version replaces the last: publish the full list every time, not just the pubkey you are adding.

### Effects of Banning:
- **Every relay**: The private, chat, outbox and inbox relays all reject events from a banned pubkey, including
  delete requests.
- **Import**: Events from banned pubkeys are skipped when importing from external relays, in both `./sanctum import`
  and the live subscription.
- **Precedence**: A ban wins over whitelisting. The owner is always skipped when the list is read, so you cannot lock
  yourself out.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the owner's list counts — a kind `10084` from anybody else is stored like any other event and ignored. Private
> (NIP-44 encrypted) list entries are not supported, since the relay has no key to decrypt them with.

Bans can also be applied over the [relay management API](relay-management.md), which keeps its own list in
`management.json`. The two are unioned, and `listbannedpubkeys` says which source each ban came from. The API cannot
lift a ban that came from your kind `10084` list, because the relay has no key to sign a replacement list with.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Banning stops writes, not reads, and gift wrapped messages are signed with throwaway keys, so a ban only stops those
> when the sender is authenticated. Events a banned user published before the ban stay in your database; delete them
> with a delete request (see below).

## Deleting Events

The relay owner (`OWNER_NPUB`) can delete **any** event stored on their relay by publishing a
[NIP-09](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/09.md) delete request (kind 5) to it, even when the event
was written by somebody else. Everybody else can only delete their own events.

A delete request applies to the relay it is sent to, so publish it to the endpoint that holds the event, for example:

```sh
nak event -k 5 -t e=<event-id> --sec <owner-nsec> wss://your.relay/inbox
```

Deletions stick: the delete request is kept, and the deleted event is refused if anybody tries to publish it again or
if it shows up while importing from your seed relays.

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting an event only removes it from your Sanctum relay. Copies on other relays are unaffected, though a delete
> request published to your outbox relay is blasted onwards like any other event.
