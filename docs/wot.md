# Web of Trust

To protect your Inbox and Chat relays from spam and unwanted messages, Sanctum implements a Web of Trust (WoT) system.
This allows you to control who can write to these relays based on your follow list.

Note that this is different and complementary to [whitelisting / blacklisting](access-control.md) which allows you to 
explicitly allow or block specific npubs regardless of their position in your WoT graph.

## Configuration

The WoT depth can be configured using the `WOT_DEPTH` environment variable:

* **Level 0**: Disabled. Anyone on Nostr who tags the relay owner or whitelisted npubs can write to the Inbox relay or 
  send messages to the Chat relay.
* **Level 1**: Private. Only the relay owner and whitelisted npubs can write to the Inbox and Chat relays.
* **Level 2**: Following. Only the relay owner, whitelisted pubs, and the people they follow directly can write to the 
  Inbox and Chat relays.
* **Level 3**: Connections of connections. The relay owner, whitelisted npubs, the people they follow, and the people 
  followed by them can write to the Inbox and Chat relays. Connections of connections must have a minimum number of 
  common followers to be included in the Web of Trust. This is the default setting.

Level 0 is not recommended, as it allows anyone to write to Inbox and Chat relays, which can lead to spam and unwanted 
interactions.

If you prefer not to store other people’s notes, Level 1 is the most private setting.

Level 2 provides direct control by allowing only people directed followed by the relay owner and whitelisted npubs to 
write to their relays, but will exclude everyone else.

Level 3 offers a good balance between privacy and spam protection by allowing connections of connections to interact 
with the relay owner and whitelisted npubs while filtering out users without a minimum number of common followers. 
However, it also requires heavier and potentially slower computation to calculate the WoT graph.

Most users should start with Level 3 and adjust the `WOT_MINIMUM_FOLLOWERS` to make the WoT more or less restrictive 
based on their preferences and the size of their follow graph.

> [!NOTE]
> When multiple pubkeys are whitelisted, their connections are merged when calculating the WoT graph. Meaning that 
> "trust" is shared between all pubkeys, and any connections deemed "trusted" by one pubkey will be trusted by all.


### Other Settings

* `WOT_MINIMUM_FOLLOWERS`: The minimum number of common followers required for someone to be included in your Web of 
  Trust at Level 3. Default is `3`.
* `WOT_FETCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: The maximum time, in seconds, that the relay will wait for a response when fetching Web 
  of Trust data from other relays. Default is `30`.
* `WOT_REFRESH_INTERVAL`: How often the relay should refresh its Web of Trust data. Supports duration strings such as
  `24h` and `1h`. Default is `24h`.
